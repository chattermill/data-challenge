The way you dispose of pictures and gifs feels very natural. The first flaw I saw with the app was the fact that you couldn't save comments (an issue which has since been fixed). Other than that, I find that some navigation is more difficult than it should be. On individual posts, I've noticed it's more difficult to navigate to the parent subreddit or access a user profile because you have to tap on the subreddit name or username. This has led to some issues: sometimes when I go to collapse comments, I will unintentionally access a user profile, or vice versa if I want to access a user's profile, I will accidentally collapse the comment thread.

An earlier version called Alien Blue has one feature that keeps me using it over all the nice features in this version.    Part of reddit's charm are the comments.   They'll provide insights, wit, or counterpoint that sometimes  eclipse the original post. They truly make reddit.  Like comments elsewhere there's lots of chaff that hides the ones that make reddit worthwhile. That's where this version fails to breast Blue. Blue enables comment thread collapse with a single tap. This version requires two taps - one to open a pop-up and another to collapse the thread. As odd as it sounds, doubling the number of taps takes more than twice as long to effect as a single tap. The pop-up, like all pop-ups, interrupt the flow as you shift attention from the contents to the pop-up. Pop-ups elsewhere are intrusive and this one's no less obnoxious.  It's a small thing that keeps me favoring Blue over this version.

The app is actually really good now. The Dev\\'s are actually listening and I apologize for my criticism before. Everything runs smoothly. I use this app every day. Just wanted to say thank you to the Reddit team for constantly working on this app and listening to feedback.   There is no longer a \"\"featured\"\" section in the middle of your home page, which is great. It now has its own tab at the top under \"\"popular\"\"/\"\"discover\"\" which is not intrusive at all.   This is pretty much the best app for Reddit right now. A lot of the others are full of ads or don\\'t have a very user friendly UI.   I just wish we could get hold to preview images and gifs like how Alien Blue had it. Then it\\'d be perfect.   2/25/17: the new update included push notifications, which is cool, but it also included one of the worst updates possible by throwing in an extremely out of place and ugly \"\"Featured\"\" section right in the middle of your front page. Not only does it stick out like a sore thumb, but it\\'s full of subs I personally don\\'t care for, hence why I\\'m not subscribed to them. So why would I want to see this on my front page? Honestly, this might be the thing that makes me switch to a different app. I miss Alien Blue. If you\\'re new and looking for a good Reddit app, look elsewhere as of now. It seems the devs either stopped listening to users or just don\\'t care.   Original review: Coming from \"\"team Alien Blue\"\" here. It\\'s not as good, but ever since they stopped supporting AB this has become better. The only issue I have is that there is no \"\"hold to preview\"\" pictures, gifs and videos. Plus it seems like it degrades images to the point where you can\\'t read small text in images (I.e screenshots of Reddit threads). But you can easily open them in Safari to fix that.     Other than that, it is pretty good. It has things AB never had like showing gold, showing tags and others.  Update: as of 12/21/16 it appears they fixed the image degrading thing. The app is really good and is constantly updating. For some reason they decided to move the voting arrows to the left side of posts which make it really awkward to use for someone that is right handed. But they kept the voting arrows on the right for comments which makes it even more awkward.

The messages is even more of an issue as well because a lot of times I might want to copy a link or snippet of text but there\\'s no option whatsoever so not only do I have to go to my browser but I also have to login.   3. Other minor Requests  Compact and card view customized to a particular subreddit  Sometimes a subreddit isn\\'t very image or video heavy so I a compact view is ideal for me while others are. Another option is adding an image/video gallery module to a subreddit which you guys already have within the \"\"discover\"\" tab  Movable subscriptions.

      "('2581', 'Worlds Leading Blog/Forum - Detailed Review', '\"I have loved this app ever since it came out, well atleast since I found it a few years ago on the web only Reddit. I have nothing but great things to say the only thing is the Banner that comes up in the Website when using a Mobile or Tablet asking to use the app. Yes I know apps are the way to go. But i really think it should be a smaller window. Just seeing it before, it covered 1/4 of my browser or iPhone 6 4.7 inch screen and was a lot of blank background space. With that as well I think you should make a \"\"don\\'t show me this again (square box to tick)\"\" until that user signs out/leaves all the Reddit pages or until the browser session is over. Then it\\'s refreshed and will be asked again to \"\"try\"\", \"\"use\"\" or \"\"download\"\" the Reddit app.   This is not Reddit alone at all... so any other app developers or people involved in apps/phone development and web development you might like to read this.  This kind of \"\"download/use out app advertising\"\" on a device\\'s websites that are co-using or completely converting to app use. In this app phenomenon that is just \"\"programs simplified\"\" and packed into an Application. Many programs are now listed under Applications on different devices with the programs not changing from the program it was rather being re-categorised as an Application. With this there has been a lot of new integration into the web development over the last several years. With apps having only exploded a couple of years ago. So people/companies are really on to it with marketing and over marketing is one thing that this instance does, can and will drive some* people away from using the app or the website at the time. Since a lot of the older users will be adjusting to the change and the simple fact that there just aren\\'t features on every app compared to its parent website. Just like Reddit.  Also for any one making anything digital making everything simple isn\\'t always right. Having a \"\"simple\"\" functionality plan is different and if your looking to make an app that\\'s simple then this will be the way to go. Simply put... There needs to be more, it can\\'t all be simple. A lot of apps as many would have seen with windows 8& 10 in particular is their very bland and ultra basic ways their apps/programs work, function and look now. Yet there is still 5 ways to do one simple thing... Personally I don\\'t like it. I prefer windows 7 a lot more. I\\'m actually planning on going to Mac as next PC or Laptop, anyhow. Sure some of the new features on W10 are great. However with the multi-functionality of everything on windows besides third party stuff is becoming more complicated for the average person who didn\\'t have the experience growing up with alt of electronics or technology let alone the technology that\\'s in our faces right now.. or they just didn\\'t have the want to learn, didn\\'t understand why at the time or perhaps the generation gap with some users has made it extremely hard for those who didn\\'t use a lot of technology that are now bis hard to get around with some people. That\\'s ok but technology as we or most now becoming forced into having online accounts and signing up to digital content that to some of them I\\'ve taught, is completely mind boggling for them and I understand why.   There\\'s another thing I want to Adress.  We could be living without energy bills since 1917. Search \"\"tesla power\"\" and why Nicolas Tesla was assassinated because the power company\\'s/coal mining/other energy production plants would be out of business or atleast put behind a whole lot. You\\'ll have to read it yourself if you want to now about it. Also another thing. We know the iPhone 9s coming but it\\'s already in development. They already know what the iPhone 10 is more or less going to look like. Sure the models will vary with consumer criticism  positive or negative.  I also want to push the fact that  Unless I was to be super picky and leave some constructive criticism which I do from time to time within the apps or websites and for Reddit I have and will continue to do so in regards to bugs & other issues, update problems, suggestions, ideas etc.   This is what you can expect to read about and shows you that there is so much to learn on Reddit.   IT IS THE NUMBER ONE SOURCE OF INFORMATION. GENUINE INFORMATION FROM OTHERS.

And needs better nicer people because you don\\'t want to get someone annoyed by you and say the f word or yell at you on social media. Its like you can\\'t do anything to help fix the problem.

Ok I think that\\'s all. :3  And some of the mods are mean or unfair. Just please tone it down with the rules. There are like five thousand eighty nine million rules. Or some how many rules there are. Just tone it down a little please and don\\'t let people use vocabulary words that are super long and hard for me to understand them. And the mods keep telling me \"\"you can\\'t do this let rule 1\"\" I mean why can\\'t I do it? I posted other posts like that and you stop me on that one post? And why can\\'t I use text box sometimes? Or something. I don\\'t like being banned or muted. I just god banned and muted twice for 72 hours and the second one.. is permanent. I don\\'t like that idea. I said PLEASE TONE DOWN ON THE RULES. Don\\'t make more rules so we feel like dogs and can\\'t do anything. And people keep saying \"\"this doesn\\'t belong here you keep just breaking the rules\"\" and \"\"you can\\'t do this\"\" or \"\"you can\\'t do that\"\" then why do we HAVE IT THEN?! Huh?! Why? I do hope your doing great Reddit. Your making people suffer of problems because of the mods and some people on there who says things like that and makes people feel bad. It\\'s always me who gets something like\"\"you did this\"\" \"\"you can\\'t do that\"\" \"\"our just breaking more rules\"\" STOP WITH THE RULES. TOO MANY. Please it\\'s very annoying to have to read all the rules and forget. Just keep the rules down low. I mean keep only a little bit of rules for all the subs. And hen Reddit will be better.  Oh, yeah and whenever I post something someone says \"\"you can\\'t do this your just breaking the rules\"\" THEN WHY CAN OTHER PEOPLE POST IT THEN?????!!!!!! And people keep giving me -1 on my comments on one of my posts! Stop that please! This is a professional app then right? Then why are people posting random stuff? And I post something and it\\'s not aloud and I break the rules????? Idk.. I\\'m going to destroy this app now. Jk. Maybe. But T.O.N.E it down with the RULES PLEASE!?... and people.

And needs better nicer people because you don\\'t want to get someone annoyed by you and say the f word or yell at you on social media. Its like you can\\'t do anything to help fix the problem.

So I can only have one account. The mods are nice and some of them are weird. They say too much. I still don\\'t understand the words they mean in their sentences. And all the rules are everywhere and it\\'s hard for me to follow them. I don\\'t know why I can\\'t to reddit in the first place.

I disagree to treat a person or talk to them that way. TREAT people with RESPECT and all that other stuff people told you about to do! It\\'s easy! Ok I think that\\'s all. :3  And some of the mods are mean or unfair. Just please tone it down with the rules. There are like five thousand eighty nine million rules. Or some how many rules there are. Just tone it down a little please and don\\'t let people use vocabulary words that are super long and hard for me to understand them. And the mods keep telling me \"\"you can\\'t do this let rule 1\"\" I mean why can\\'t I do it? I posted other posts like that and you stop me on that one post? And why can\\'t I use text box sometimes? Or something. I don\\'t like being banned or muted. I just god banned and muted twice for 72 hours and the second one.. is permanent. I don\\'t like that idea. I said PLEASE TONE DOWN ON THE RULES. Don\\'t make more rules so we feel like dogs and can\\'t do anything. And people keep saying \"\"this doesn\\'t belong here you keep just breaking the rules\"\" and \"\"you can\\'t do this\"\" or \"\"you can\\'t do that\"\" then why do we HAVE IT THEN?! Huh?! Why? I do hope your doing great Reddit. Your making people suffer of problems because of the mods and some people on there who says things like that and makes people feel bad. It\\'s always me who gets something like\"\"you did this\"\" \"\"you can\\'t do that\"\" \"\"our just breaking more rules\"\" STOP WITH THE RULES. TOO MANY. Please it\\'s very annoying to have to read all the rules and forget. Just keep the rules down low. I mean keep only a little bit of rules for all the subs. And hen Reddit will be better.  Oh, yeah and whenever I post something someone says \"\"you can\\'t do this your just breaking the rules\"\" THEN WHY CAN OTHER PEOPLE POST IT THEN?????!!!!!! And people keep giving me -1 on my comments on one of my posts! Stop that please! This is a professional app then right? Then why are people posting random stuff? And I post something and it\\'s not aloud and I break the rules????? Idk.. I\\'m going to destroy this app now. Jk. Maybe. But T.O.N.E it down with the RULES PLEASE!?... and people.

You can subscribe to different communities called sub-Reddits and post there, ask questions, answer people's questions, discuss the topic of the community, and other things too. There are very many communities for so many different topics and if you don't like the community for a topic you are interested in, chances are there are other communities based around the same thing. It's a very entertaining app in my opinion. I can learn things, talk about topics, help others with a question, laugh about the funny subreddits, and a lot more.

However, if used properly, you may find that you are more knowledgeable about important subjects such as politics, foreign affairs, and other such subjects that aren't covered by the media.

The iPad version of this app is pretty pitiful and has been for quite a while.  The UI doesn't properly scale to fill the iPad's larger screen.  The app shouldn't only be using 40% - 50% of the screen real estate directly in the center of the screen with large gaps on both sides.  I shouldn't have to reach into the center of the screen to scroll when using my iPad in landscape.  The app doesn't work properly in split view at all, half of the UI gets cut off which makes the app unusable.  Other than that the App is stable and operates smoothly, I never really have any problems with the app crashing or hanging.  But, until the UI scales to properly fill the entire iPad screen and works properly in split view my review will stay at 3/5 stars.

It\\'s annoying me and making me suffer through annoyingness. I am sorry but it just needs more work. And needs better nicer people because you don\\'t want to get someone annoyed by you and say the f word or yell at you on social media. Its like you can\\'t do anything to help fix the problem. I love reddit but I feel I can\\'t post anything. I have three accounts I think and I\\'m trying to find out what they are. But I can\\'t. I don\\'t remember. I want to get them deleted for good. So I can only have one account. The mods are nice and some of them are weird. They say too much. I still don\\'t understand the words they mean in their sentences. And all the rules are everywhere and it\\'s hard for me to follow them. I don\\'t know why I can\\'t to reddit in the first place. And I don\\'t know why there are 5828488493948583948578494758948 rules for everything. I mean what the what?! It\\'s annoying, hard, overwhelming, annoying, fun (sometimes), boring, etc... but I still like this app. I just need the rules and everything that annoys people or all that stuff be fixed as well. Plez? I can\\'t stand it *sits on spiny chair* hope you like what your doing! Because your making some people suffer through the rules and trying to follow them and also talking to people for help and then they yell at them. THAT IS NOT NICE. I disagree to treat a person or talk to them that way. TREAT people with RESPECT and all that other stuff people told you about to do! It\\'s easy! Ok I think that\\'s all. :3  And some of the mods are mean or unfair. Just please tone it down with the rules. There are like five thousand eighty nine million rules. Or some how many rules there are. Just tone it down a little please and don\\'t let people use vocabulary words that are super long and hard for me to understand them. And the mods keep telling me \"\"you can\\'t do this let rule 1\"\" I mean why can\\'t I do it? I posted other posts like that and you stop me on that one post? And why can\\'t I use text box sometimes? Or something. I don\\'t like being banned or muted. I just god banned and muted twice for 72 hours and the second one.. is permanent. I don\\'t like that idea. I said PLEASE TONE DOWN ON THE RULES. Don\\'t make more rules so we feel like dogs and can\\'t do anything. And people keep saying \"\"this doesn\\'t belong here you keep just breaking the rules\"\" and \"\"you can\\'t do this\"\" or \"\"you can\\'t do that\"\" then why do we HAVE IT THEN?! Huh?! Why? I do hope your doing great Reddit. Your making people suffer of problems because of the mods and some people on there who says things like that and makes people feel bad. It\\'s always me who gets something like\"\"you did this\"\" \"\"you can\\'t do that\"\" \"\"our just breaking more rules\"\" STOP WITH THE RULES. TOO MANY. Please it\\'s very annoying to have to read all the rules and forget. Just keep the rules down low. I mean keep only a little bit of rules for all the subs. And hen Reddit will be better.  Oh, yeah and whenever I post something someone says \"\"you can\\'t do this your just breaking the rules\"\" THEN WHY CAN OTHER PEOPLE POST IT THEN?????!!!!!! And people keep giving me -1 on my comments on one of my posts! Stop that please! This is a professional app then right? Then why are people posting random stuff? And I post something and it\\'s not aloud and I break the rules????? Idk.. I\\'m going to destroy this app now. Jk. Maybe. But T.O.N.E it down with the RULES PLEASE!?... and people.

And needs better nicer people because you don\\'t want to get someone annoyed by you and say the f word or yell at you on social media. Its like you can\\'t do anything to help fix the problem. I love reddit but I feel I can\\'t post anything. I have three accounts I think and I\\'m trying to find out what they are. But I can\\'t. I don\\'t remember. I want to get them deleted for good. So I can only have one account. The mods are nice and some of them are weird. They say too much. I still don\\'t understand the words they mean in their sentences. And all the rules are everywhere and it\\'s hard for me to follow them. I don\\'t know why I can\\'t to reddit in the first place. And I don\\'t know why there are 5828488493948583948578494758948 rules for everything. I mean what the what?! It\\'s annoying, hard, overwhelming, annoying, fun (sometimes), boring, etc... but I still like this app. I just need the rules and everything that annoys people or all that stuff be fixed as well. Plez? I can\\'t stand it *sits on spiny chair* hope you like what your doing! Because your making some people suffer through the rules and trying to follow them and also talking to people for help and then they yell at them. THAT IS NOT NICE. I disagree to treat a person or talk to them that way. TREAT people with RESPECT and all that other stuff people told you about to do! It\\'s easy! Ok I think that\\'s all. :3  And some of the mods are mean or unfair. Just please tone it down with the rules. There are like five thousand eighty nine million rules. Or some how many rules there are. Just tone it down a little please and don\\'t let people use vocabulary words that are super long and hard for me to understand them. And the mods keep telling me \"\"you can\\'t do this let rule 1\"\" I mean why can\\'t I do it? I posted other posts like that and you stop me on that one post? And why can\\'t I use text box sometimes? Or something. I don\\'t like being banned or muted. I just god banned and muted twice for 72 hours and the second one.. is permanent. I don\\'t like that idea. I said PLEASE TONE DOWN ON THE RULES. Don\\'t make more rules so we feel like dogs and can\\'t do anything. And people keep saying \"\"this doesn\\'t belong here you keep just breaking the rules\"\" and \"\"you can\\'t do this\"\" or \"\"you can\\'t do that\"\" then why do we HAVE IT THEN?! Huh?! Why? I do hope your doing great Reddit. Your making people suffer of problems because of the mods and some people on there who says things like that and makes people feel bad. It\\'s always me who gets something like\"\"you did this\"\" \"\"you can\\'t do that\"\" \"\"our just breaking more rules\"\" STOP WITH THE RULES. TOO MANY. Please it\\'s very annoying to have to read all the rules and forget. Just keep the rules down low. I mean keep only a little bit of rules for all the subs. And hen Reddit will be better.  Oh, yeah and whenever I post something someone says \"\"you can\\'t do this your just breaking the rules\"\" THEN WHY CAN OTHER PEOPLE POST IT THEN?????!!!!!! And people keep giving me -1 on my comments on one of my posts! Stop that please! This is a professional app then right? Then why are people posting random stuff?
