I prefer the app to the website!,"I have been using the internet since 1997ish, and only went out of my way to visit the desktop browser version of Reddit this past year. I had heard about it, but what I had heard led message to believe that it was a slightly more user friendly version of 4chan, which I (as a writer/proof reader as well as a kind, loving, and 99.9% non-confrontational person) had been advised to avoid at all costs... but I suppose it surely has evolved into its own entity as I enjoy the site and way too many subs a whole bunch. I love this app though, even more than the website as it is 100% user-friendly! Most of the people are nice, trolls are hunted down and muted, and yeah...if you are searching for a public forum for just about any topic or subject you can imagine (and plenty you have never even imagined too), or are already a fan of Reddit, you should absolutely get this app right now!!",Reddit Official App: Trending News and Hot Topics,US,5,2009-07-17,13,13,<20,1st_quantile

New posts have little chance,"I really love this app but have one problem that ultimately hurts me and lots of others, it automatically shows you the most popular in a reddit rather than the most recent, so not enough people see the new ones to make them popular, you can set it to where it shows you new ones instead, but most either don't know about it or can't be bothered, so really good posts get ignored because the ones that get attention are shown to more people instead of the newer ones, a lot of the time this isn't a problem, but on reddits like writing prompts, it can be hard to get the attention you need to get comments that are relevant",Reddit Official App: Trending News and Hot Topics,US,3,2009-07-17,8,32,<20,1st_quantile

The Best App for Reddit,"Tried a few imitations, but keep coming back to this one. Fantastic interface!",Reddit Official App: Trending News and Hot Topics,US,5,2008-07-17,18,91,<20,3rd_quantile
"Smooth interface, some minor flaws","I've been using the app since it first came out. I love how smooth and natural the interface is. The way you dispose of pictures and gifs feels very natural. The first flaw I saw with the app was the fact that you couldn't save comments (an issue which has since been fixed). Other than that, I find that some navigation is more difficult than it should be. On individual posts, I've noticed it's more difficult to navigate to the parent subreddit or access a user profile because you have to tap on the subreddit name or username. This has led to some issues: sometimes when I go to collapse comments, I will unintentionally access a user profile, or vice versa if I want to access a user's profile, I will accidentally collapse the comment thread. I'm a person with large thumbs, so this may be a few and far between issue. My original go-to Reddit app was BaconReader, which moved the user profile link for each comment into their options button (three dots) for each comment and post, a system which I prefer. Still, the app works great, no complaints on performance.",Reddit Official App: Trending News and Hot Topics,US,4,2008-07-17,42,125,40-60,3rd_quantile

Maybe you could opt out of silent videos or just fix it so that silent videos don't replace actual audio.

It's okay,"This app does what I need it do most of the time.

Gfycat videos play so choppily, it's terrible. You get like 5fps. If you can navigate the app's UI to somehow open the Gfycat link in Safari, it's very smooth. I've started using the Beam Reddit app just because it plays Gfycats smoothly in-app. Subreddits like /R/overwatch have a lot of Gfycat links, so it's super annoying when they all play terribly by default in this Reddit app. 

The biggest struggle I have is with watching YouTube videos within it. I'd rather the links just open in the YouTube app. Best I can get is watch it within the Reddit app or open it in Safari, but it takes too many clicks to open it in Safari even.

"They continue to add ""enhancements"" that annoy","Update: this app has gotten even worse since I first poster this review. This app is a joke
I can't recommend this app. I went back to it for a while and they just recently changed more stuff that makes me regret going back. 
First they flipped stuff around that made it hard if you are right handed. 
Now they have made it so that looking through your subbed subreddit is even harder.  Next to where you scroll through your subbed subreddits they added a button to pin it to the top of the list. It's extremely easy to hit that after scrolling. You will then have scroll all the way back to the top so that you can unpin it.

Blue is better in one significant way,"There are a lot of features to like in this version that I'll leave to the five star reviews to gush over. 

An earlier version called Alien Blue has one feature that keeps me using it over all the nice features in this version.  

Part of reddit's charm are the comments.   They'll provide insights, wit, or counterpoint that sometimes  eclipse the original post. They truly make reddit.

Like comments elsewhere there's lots of chaff that hides the ones that make reddit worthwhile. That's where this version fails to breast Blue. Blue enables comment thread collapse with a single tap. This version requires two taps - one to open a pop-up and another to collapse the thread. As odd as it sounds, doubling the number of taps takes more than twice as long to effect as a single tap. The pop-up, like all pop-ups, interrupt the flow as you shift attention from the contents to the pop-up. Pop-ups elsewhere are intrusive and this one's no less obnoxious.

It's a small thing that keeps me favoring Blue over this version. There are  many terrific features  in this version that I know of and there may be more waiting to be found that will remain unfound until this version has single-tap-collapse as one of its features.",Reddit Official App: Trending News and Hot Topics,US,3,2002-07-17,76,152,>60,4th_quantile

Works so good my legs went numb.,"Sat down for my daily meeting on the porcelain throne, and as usual, I had to browse Reddit because this meeting turned into a longer one than expected. I seemed to get lost in the east maneuverability around the Reddit site through this app. The ease of use, with which I was able to submit posts, attach pictures and links for zero upvotes and demoralizing comments, was unbelievable! So much so that my legs went numb from excessively long sitting. I had to get up and my feet slapped on the tile floors with no feelings with sounds of clapping.

"Why must you do this, Reddit?","What is this new Reddit application thing? Why do people have to apply for a website now? Is this that net neutrality thing you talk about?

I love your website though. Just stop making me fill out applications and give my info to strangers. My social security number is mine, mine only.

I do however dislike the regular pestering for a rating. If it was revolutionary I'd have been happy to extend a positive rating, however it's just good enough.  Once or twice is fine, but it's requested a rating many more times now and I believe ratings should be relatively organic.",Reddit Official App: Trending News and Hot Topics,US,3,2029-06-17,74,370,>60,5th_quantile

Better than most social media,"I've been using Reddit for about a year now, and it's ok.
It's better than FB or other social media sites.
There is still a lot of fake news going around, but luckily people usually get called-out when they post BS.
Many subs do not promote truth though, and it is easy to get banned for pointing out errors. There are lots of one sided subs.
There are also lots of trolls, mostly from under the bridge of r/the_Donald. But if you don't take their bait, they crawl back into there holes soon enough.

It's by the far the best app out right now and you can pretty much communicate freely in there, even though the main mods vote it down so its not at the top. The people in the actual community are really cool. I rate it 4 stars for that reason. Because the attack on conservative speech right now (i dont care what people say its true) there are more subs in that community than any other and it gets flagged for its content. HOWEVER there are other subs that are pretty cool. I love the art and photography and there are some pretty funny stuff too.

The best way to browse Reddit on your iPhone.,"6/27/17: I feel like I'm probably the only one here that keeps updating their comments like this... but, whatever. The app is actually really good now. The Dev's are actually listening and I apologize for my criticism before. Everything runs smoothly. I use this app every day. Just wanted to say thank you to the Reddit team for constantly working on this app and listening to feedback. 

There is no longer a ""featured"" section in the middle of your home page, which is great. It now has its own tab at the top under ""popular""/""discover"" which is not intrusive at all. 

This is pretty much the best app for Reddit right now. A lot of the others are full of ads or don't have a very user friendly UI. 

I just wish we could get hold to preview images and gifs like how Alien Blue had it. Then it'd be perfect. 

2/25/17: the new update included push notifications, which is cool, but it also included one of the worst updates possible by throwing in an extremely out of place and ugly ""Featured"" section right in the middle of your front page. Not only does it stick out like a sore thumb, but it's full of subs I personally don't care for, hence why I'm not subscribed to them. So why would I want to see this on my front page? Honestly, this might be the thing that makes me switch to a different app. I miss Alien Blue. If you're new and looking for a good Reddit app, look elsewhere as of now. It seems the devs either stopped listening to users or just don't care. 

Original review: Coming from ""team Alien Blue"" here. It's not as good, but ever since they stopped supporting AB this has become better. The only issue I have is that there is no ""hold to preview"" pictures, gifs and videos. Plus it seems like it degrades images to the point where you can't read small text in images (I.e screenshots of Reddit threads). But you can easily open them in Safari to fix that.   

Other than that, it is pretty good. It has things AB never had like showing gold, showing tags and others.

Update: as of 12/21/16 it appears they fixed the image degrading thing. The app is really good and is constantly updating. For some reason they decided to move the voting arrows to the left side of posts which make it really awkward to use for someone that is right handed. But they kept the voting arrows on the right for comments which makes it even more awkward. I hope they make this an optional feature in the future.",Reddit Official App: Trending News and Hot Topics,US,5,2027-06-17,12,36,<20,1st_quantile

1. Multi-reddit configuration

2. ""Copy text"" option on
a. OP's original post
b. Inbox/messages

This option is only available on comments within a thread but if I want to copy a snippet from the initial post, I can only use share and only copy the link to thread itself and then I'd have to open it on my mobile browser.

The messages is even more of an issue as well because a lot of times I might want to copy a link or snippet of text but there's no option whatsoever so not only do I have to go to my browser but I also have to login. 

3. Other minor Requests

Compact and card view customized to a particular subreddit

Sometimes a subreddit isn't very image or video heavy so I a compact view is ideal for me while others are. Another option is adding an image/video gallery module to a subreddit which you guys already have within the ""discover"" tab

Movable subscriptions. You can favorite a subreddit but after that you have to remove it all in reorder it. Perhaps manual reordering rather as an option along side the default alphabetical could work too",Reddit Official App: Trending News and Hot Topics,US,3,2018-06-17,87,348,>60,5th_quantile

Decent but newest update is not great.,"Works well as an app to browse reddit. Never really have issues with loading pages or any of the media.

Some recommended changes,"Overall, the updates were good. But I would like to address some changes. First off, please bring the ""write a post"" thing back to the bottom bar. It's annoying to scroll all the way to the top. Second, I get these notifications. When I get multiple of the same post, I have to click through every single one of them to get rid of the notification. Please make it so that all the notifications of each post disappears when I read it. For example, if I get two different post notifications, I click one of them and both are on my screen, I want both of them to be gone. I would like an indicator, like an orange dot (or a balloon) on unread notifications. Finally, when I click on the notification, and click back, please make it so that it shows that I read it.

Worlds Leading Blog/Forum - Detailed Review,"I have loved this app ever since it came out, well atleast since I found it a few years ago on the web only Reddit. I have nothing but great things to say the only thing is the Banner that comes up in the Website when using a Mobile or Tablet asking to use the app. Yes I know apps are the way to go. But i really think it should be a smaller window. Just seeing it before, it covered 1/4 of my browser or iPhone 6 4.7 inch screen and was a lot of blank background space. With that as well I think you should make a ""don't show me this again (square box to tick)"" until that user signs out/leaves all the Reddit pages or until the browser session is over. Then it's refreshed and will be asked again to ""try"", ""use"" or ""download"" the Reddit app. 

This is not Reddit alone at all... so any other app developers or people involved in apps/phone development and web development you might like to read this.

This kind of ""download/use out app advertising"" on a device's websites that are co-using or completely converting to app use. In this app phenomenon that is just ""programs simplified"" and packed into an Application. Many programs are now listed under Applications on different devices with the programs not changing from the program it was rather being re-categorised as an Application.
With this there has been a lot of new integration into the web development over the last several years. With apps having only exploded a couple of years ago. So people/companies are really on to it with marketing and over marketing is one thing that this instance does, can and will drive some* people away from using the app or the website at the time. Since a lot of the older users will be adjusting to the change and the simple fact that there just aren't features on every app compared to its parent website. Just like Reddit.

Also for any one making anything digital making everything simple isn't always right. Having a ""simple"" functionality plan is different and if your looking to make an app that's simple then this will be the way to go. Simply put... There needs to be more, it can't all be simple. A lot of apps as many would have seen with windows 8& 10 in particular is their very bland and ultra basic ways their apps/programs work, function and look now. Yet there is still 5 ways to do one simple thing... Personally I don't like it. I prefer windows 7 a lot more. I'm actually planning on going to Mac as next PC or Laptop, anyhow. Sure some of the new features on W10 are great. However with the multi-functionality of everything on windows besides third party stuff is becoming more complicated for the average person who didn't have the experience growing up with alt of electronics or technology let alone the technology that's in our faces right now.. or they just didn't have the want to learn, didn't understand why at the time or perhaps the generation gap with some users has made it extremely hard for those who didn't use a lot of technology that are now bis hard to get around with some people. That's ok but technology as we or most now becoming forced into having online accounts and signing up to digital content that to some of them I've taught, is completely mind boggling for them and I understand why. 

There's another thing I want to Adress. 
We could be living without energy bills since 1917. Search ""tesla power"" and why Nicolas Tesla was assassinated because the power company's/coal mining/other energy production plants would be out of business or atleast put behind a whole lot. You'll have to read it yourself if you want to now about it. Also another thing. We know the iPhone 9s coming but it's already in development. They already know what the iPhone 10 is more or less going to look like. Sure the models will vary with consumer criticism  positive or negative.

I also want to push the fact that 
Unless I was to be super picky and leave some constructive criticism which I do from time to time within the apps or websites and for Reddit I have and will continue to do so in regards to bugs & other issues, update problems, suggestions, ideas etc. 

This is what you can expect to read about and shows you that there is so much to learn on Reddit. 

IT IS THE NUMBER ONE SOURCE OF INFORMATION. GENUINE INFORMATION FROM OTHERS.

The front page of the internet will not be refused,"I am a late engager in the world of reddit - quite frankly it overwhelmed me and the moderator rules in the writing section gave me ""troll - wikieditor - scathing intellectual dressing down in public"" fears & anxiety.
I hoped I could let it go but alas I found my way to some subreddits in the underground where I felt safe and next thing I know I'm IFTTT - IN some valuable reddit feeds and getting a nice summary done for me (most of these curated email ""autobot for your thought"" lists are merely opportunities procrasturbation. 

Reddit seems relevant. I never liked the desktop feed constantly displayed on a coworkers' screen (too DOS like for me, a spreadsheet is never my go-to visual aesthetic) while he was supposedly working. Then the archery subreddits got me to narwhal app whose dark theme I liked and then reddit kept coercing me to use the teletubbie icon app. 

And after a few weeks, I find myself using it more and will probably delete the more newsfeed clunky feel of narwhal in favor of the native reddit app.

Garbage-ish,"Needs Some work. More work! because there is too many rules for everything and I think it's all unfair. The mods say long messages and I don't understand. It's annoying me and making me suffer through annoyingness. I am sorry but it just needs more work. And needs better nicer people because you don't want to get someone annoyed by you and say the f word or yell at you on social media. Its like you can't do anything to help fix the problem. I love reddit but I feel I can't post anything. I have three accounts I think and I'm trying to find out what they are. But I can't. I don't remember. I want to get them deleted for good. So I can only have one account. The mods are nice and some of them are weird. They say too much. I still don't understand the words they mean in their sentences. And all the rules are everywhere and it's hard for me to follow them. I don't know why I can't to reddit in the first place. And I don't know why there are 5828488493948583948578494758948 rules for everything. I mean what the what?! It's annoying, hard, overwhelming, annoying, fun (sometimes), boring, etc... but I still like this app. I just need the rules and everything that annoys people or all that stuff be fixed as well. Plez? I can't stand it *sits on spiny chair* hope you like what your doing! Because your making some people suffer through the rules and trying to follow them and also talking to people for help and then they yell at them. THAT IS NOT NICE. I disagree to treat a person or talk to them that way. TREAT people with RESPECT and all that other stuff people told you about to do! It's easy! Ok I think that's all. :3

And some of the mods are mean or unfair. Just please tone it down with the rules. There are like five thousand eighty nine million rules. Or some how many rules there are. Just tone it down a little please and don't let people use vocabulary words that are super long and hard for me to understand them. And the mods keep telling me ""you can't do this let rule 1"" I mean why can't I do it? I posted other posts like that and you stop me on that one post? And why can't I use text box sometimes? Or something. I don't like being banned or muted. I just god banned and muted twice for 72 hours and the second one.. is permanent. I don't like that idea. I said PLEASE TONE DOWN ON THE RULES. Don't make more rules so we feel like dogs and can't do anything. And people keep saying ""this doesn't belong here you keep just breaking the rules"" and ""you can't do this"" or ""you can't do that"" then why do we HAVE IT THEN?! Huh?! Why? I do hope your doing great Reddit. Your making people suffer of problems because of the mods and some people on there who says things like that and makes people feel bad. It's always me who gets something like""you did this"" ""you can't do that"" ""our just breaking more rules"" STOP WITH THE RULES. TOO MANY. Please it's very annoying to have to read all the rules and forget. Just keep the rules down low. I mean keep only a little bit of rules for all the subs. And hen Reddit will be better.

Oh, yeah and whenever I post something someone says ""you can't do this your just breaking the rules"" THEN WHY CAN OTHER PEOPLE POST IT THEN?????!!!!!! And people keep giving me -1 on my comments on one of my posts! Stop that please! This is a professional app then right? Then why are people posting random stuff? And I post something and it's not aloud and I break the rules????? Idk.. I'm going to destroy this app now. Jk. Maybe. But T.O.N.E it down with the RULES PLEASE!?... and people. One person: u/Algernon_asimov is still making me sad and worried. In Trying my best on this app I really am. Wish I could delete messages within the app. And so things that I CAN do.

Reddit just needs to change.

AirPlay issues.,"I like to Airplay music to my Apple TV while browsing Reddit, but it's annoying as GIFs automatically are airplayed to my tv when they show up while I'm scrolling. Please change this. Maybe only airplay the GIF if it's clicked on or something. But I don't think it should automatically airplay just because it shows up while scrolling. I don't want everyone in the living room to see what GIFs pop up since Reddit tends to be... unpredictable at times.",Reddit Official App: Trending News and Hot Topics,US,2,2017-06-07,16,16,<20,1st_quantile

The purest way to browse the front page of the internet,"After deleting my Facebook account (I got sick of the negativity, clickbait, politics, and generally useless time waste that Facebook is) I turned to Reddit to satisfy the occasional need for interesting news and dank memes. It does not disappoint.  I'm not new to reddit but I haven't visited it much in the last few years and last time I checked on iPhone there wasn't an OFFICIAL app. So of course when I found this app I gave it a shot and it's a very clean simple interface that makes navigating and partaking in the communities you choose very easy and enjoyable. More importantly it's quick to use so you don't wind up wasting hours away while accomplishing nothing like Facebook does.

Terrible,"The forum design on the app and on desktop I personally find terrible, that aside what ruins Reddit for me is the fact that it is becoming more of a site for big spending advertisers to show their junk while someone like me has to face so many difficult to work with/backwards rules that I believe will eventually back fire in reddits face down the road, plus it just looks and feels like a cheap version of ifunny but then again this is all just my opinion and really all that matters is wether u enjoy it or not.

Reddit is manipulated by US security agencies,"Reddit is known to be heavily manipulated by us intelligence operations. The following excerpt is from the Washington Post, which itself was a copy and paste from a blog entry on Reddit:

Notice Eglin Air Force Base as the ‚Äúmost addicted‚Äù city. This is about a year ago, so reddit has been getting heavily sh!tp0sted by government employees for at least this long.

Eglin AFB is a major hub for Pentagon domestic manipulation programs online.

A lot of this got established right when the war on terror started. Then in 2012 the Smith-Mundt Modernization Act legalized Pentagon / other agency domestic propaganda. That‚Äôs not to say what we think of as ‚Äòpropaganda‚Äô or manipulation wasn‚Äôt going on before ‚Äì just that they no longer have to plausibly believe the narrative they try to trick you into buying.",Reddit Official App: Trending News and Hot Topics,US,1,2004-06-17,62,310,>60,5th_quantile

Push notifications are out of control.,"It's nice Reddit finally decided to cater to mobile users and create their own app but the push notifications make this app infuriating to have installed. 

The app insists on sending me notifications about posts I have no interest in. I have turned off ""recommended posts"" in my notification settings and yet I still receive notifications I don't want. 

Additionally, even after I have cleared the unwanted notifications, when I open the Reddit app I'm immediately taken to the post I was notified about. They have made it impossible to ignore their unwanted notifications. 

Honestly even Facebook isn't this bad - trying to push Reddit in users faces all the time is pathetic. I'll be going back to an unofficial app until Reddit sorts out how to deliver push notifications without being overbearing.",Reddit Official App: Trending News and Hot Topics,US,1,2017-06-03,51,51,40-60,2nd_quantile

That really annoyed me because the font is different and I get kicked out of the app!  This was basically the only thing I disliked about the app.

Reddit is fairly fun I guess,"I searched covfefe, like anyone would. So far I'm duly entertained. I'm. It sure why reddit wants me to ""do less,"" though. Like, after I clicked on a few arrows and felt ready to make my very own comment, Reddit app said I was doing ""too much"" and my only choices were ""discard"" & ""keep editing."" Bc my comment was like two words, I couldn't think of any more-accurate two words, so I had to click ""discard"" and my opinion on covfefe will never be recorded only to get lost in the social-media jungle anyway... I think my two words on the subject deserve at least to be posted. So what does Reddit mean by saying ""you're doing too much, try again in eight minutes?"" Is it a mobile-app thing that needs work, or is Reddit actually telling me to ""shut up for now, try speaking up later?""

If it's the latter, then screw this. If not, what's the Reddit problem with me typing words? I can click as many arrows as I want to, but words? ""You're doing too much"" by using my words, says the Reddit app. Why? I've consulted the FAQ, so, what the FUQ?

I hope I have a chance to use my words at some point bc they're worth reading. Says me & my 43 Facebook friends, at least. Haha, y'all are silly like that.",Reddit Official App: Trending News and Hot Topics,US,4,2017-06-01,64,320,>60,5th_quantile

Why?,"This app is useless. It doesn't use the available screen real estate of the iPad. It's just the phone version with rotation hacked in. It doesn't even do that correctly. It places the cards in the middle 40% of the screen with huge bars of nothingness on both sides. 
Why can't we just get an updated version of Alien Blue?",Reddit Official App: Trending News and Hot Topics,US,1,2017-06-01,58,232,40-60,4th_quantile
"Reddit is an amazing app, but...","I don't like that the post button has been changed. I really liked where the post button was before this update. Now, it's a hassle having to scroll back to the top of the page to post something whereas it was more convenient at the bottom where the other search tools are. 

Also, Tweetbot has this feature where the user can flick their screen and the screen will change between day and night mode. If Reddit can implement this feature, this would definitely be a win-win. This is just for easier access instead of going into the settings page.",Reddit Official App: Trending News and Hot Topics,US,4,2017-06-01,12,60,<20,2nd_quantile

Solid Mobile App for Reddit!,"I was a long time Alien Blue user, but, late last year, they announced they were stopping their app--still possibly available in store but they re not updating anymore. 

Since then, I've used Reddit and it's very solid. 

Being a former AB user, there is one hung I'd like that to see: The casual subreddits option. 

You could save subs to a ""casual"" tab--this means you don't subscribe to them but can still easily access subs you don't subscribe to. 

Reddit has added multi subs so this helps some but, for those places you don't subscribe to, it's nice for the casual option. 

Either way, 5/5. Solid app",Reddit Official App: Trending News and Hot Topics,US,5,2017-06-01,21,21,20-40,1st_quantile

Garbage-ish,"Needs Some work. More work! because there is too many rules for everything and I think it's all unfair. The mods say long messages and I don't understand. It's annoying me and making me suffer through annoyingness. I am sorry but it just needs more work. And needs better nicer people because you don't want to get someone annoyed by you and say the f word or yell at you on social media. Its like you can't do anything to help fix the problem. I love reddit but I feel I can't post anything. I have three accounts I think and I'm trying to find out what they are. But I can't. I don't remember. I want to get them deleted for good. So I can only have one account. The mods are nice and some of them are weird. They say too much. I still don't understand the words they mean in their sentences. And all the rules are everywhere and it's hard for me to follow them. I don't know why I can't to reddit in the first place. And I don't know why there are 5828488493948583948578494758948 rules for everything. I mean what the what?! It's annoying, hard, overwhelming, annoying, fun (sometimes), boring, etc... but I still like this app. I just need the rules and everything that annoys people or all that stuff be fixed as well. Plez? I can't stand it *sits on spiny chair* hope you like what your doing! Because your making some people suffer through the rules and trying to follow them and also talking to people for help and then they yell at them. THAT IS NOT NICE. I disagree to treat a person or talk to them that way. TREAT people with RESPECT and all that other stuff people told you about to do! It's easy! Ok I think that's all. :3

And some of the mods are mean or unfair. Just please tone it down with the rules. There are like five thousand eighty nine million rules. Or some how many rules there are. Just tone it down a little please and don't let people use vocabulary words that are super long and hard for me to understand them. And the mods keep telling me ""you can't do this let rule 1"" I mean why can't I do it? I posted other posts like that and you stop me on that one post? And why can't I use text box sometimes? Or something. I don't like being banned or muted. I just god banned and muted twice for 72 hours and the second one.. is permanent. I don't like that idea. I said PLEASE TONE DOWN ON THE RULES. Don't make more rules so we feel like dogs and can't do anything. And people keep saying ""this doesn't belong here you keep just breaking the rules"" and ""you can't do this"" or ""you can't do that"" then why do we HAVE IT THEN?! Huh?! Why? I do hope your doing great Reddit. Your making people suffer of problems because of the mods and some people on there who says things like that and makes people feel bad. It's always me who gets something like""you did this"" ""you can't do that"" ""our just breaking more rules"" STOP WITH THE RULES. TOO MANY. Please it's very annoying to have to read all the rules and forget. Just keep the rules down low. I mean keep only a little bit of rules for all the subs. And hen Reddit will be better.

Oh, yeah and whenever I post something someone says ""you can't do this your just breaking the rules"" THEN WHY CAN OTHER PEOPLE POST IT THEN?????!!!!!! And people keep giving me -1 on my comments on one of my posts! Stop that please! This is a professional app then right? Then why are people posting random stuff? And I post something and it's not aloud and I break the rules????? Idk.. I'm going to destroy this app now. Jk. Maybe. But T.O.N.E it down with the RULES PLEASE!?... and people. One person: u/Algernon_asimov is still making me sad and worried. In Trying my best on this app I really am. Wish I could delete messages within the app. And so things that I CAN do.

I have perfect vision and I'm using this app on my iPhone 7 plus, so I believe I can't get bigger font size with your app's restrictions. I wish you allow system font size to be applied on the app instead of your custom font sizes. Some people who are using accessibility features for vision on the iPhone can't use your app without a magnifier, and it does not make it an enjoyable experience.

Alien Blue was a hundred times better,"You can't browse by all your favorite subreddits like you could in Alien blue. Instead you can only browse r/all or go to each subreddit individually. Which is pretty irritating because half of r/all is always porn.

 New update is clunky, app now has a post at the top of EVERY subreddit where if you click it let's you make a post. Completely unnecessary and I've already clicked it multiple times absentmindedly thinking it's the top post of a sub.

 Also a criticism of Reddit in general and not so much the app, be prepared for 10 threads a day about Donald Trump being the worst person ever gets very annoying. You block 8 subs every day and 8 new ones pop up. I'm not a trump supporter nor am I against him, but regardless I don't want to have to see half of the front page talking about him every day of the year.",Reddit Official App: Trending News and Hot Topics,US,2,2017-06-01,65,325,>60,5th_quantile

Almost perfect,"I made myself switch from Alien Blue a few months back when it became borderline unusable w broken / missing features and little by little, the reddit app has gotten much better. Almost perfect at this point with how fast and well organized it is. Really like that in this update, the post button has been moved inline instead of on the bottom bar (as I rarely post stuff, just browse). 

The few things I'd like are a safari view controller for links (so that I can use a content blocker for the really bad sites), 3D touch on thumbnails, less review prompts (I feel like I get 20 a month), and movable subreddit favorites that aren't organized alphabetically.

Love this app so far,"A few years back I would always see different social apps, whether it be Instagram, facebook, twitter, youtube, Snapchat, ifunny, twitch, Kik, discord, reddit, and others. Many of them serve different purposes compared to each other, and I never understood Reddit and never downloaded it. A few days ago I downloaded it and I like it very much. You can subscribe to different communities called sub-Reddits and post there, ask questions, answer people's questions, discuss the topic of the community, and other things too. There are very many communities for so many different topics and if you don't like the community for a topic you are interested in, chances are there are other communities based around the same thing. It's a very entertaining app in my opinion. I can learn things, talk about topics, help others with a question, laugh about the funny subreddits, and a lot more.

Once you step into the foot hold of Reddit you can adventure to any land you wish, there is a community for everything no matter how vulgar or innocent, no matter your culture or background there is a place for discussion in this app. 

I personally suggest that every user with access to the internet download this app, it is really brilliant and I feel like most other Reddit users can agree with me on that.

Another Alien Blue expatiate coming 'round,"Edit 4/18/2017 - background music keeps pausing when I open the app. Super annoying. 

Like many I was dismayed initially with this app, after using Alien Blue for years. It did not take long to come around to this, the official app, however. Gone are Alien Blue's difficult diagonal controls and inefficient pull-to-preview gimmick. The official app is fast (albeit a little crashy) and has the look and feel of a modern app. I'm confident this honeymoon period will end when Conde Nast starts to push monetization, but for now the app works well enough and looks good doing so.

Edit: less crashy now

Edit: good communication from devs. App generally gets better, but leaves some head scratchers too. Why can't subreddits be dynamically selected for compact view?

Too pretentious for its own good,"Ex-baconreader veteran here, have been trying several times to use this app, and I just can't do it. It's awful.

First, it seems as if the developers have favoured looks over features, took me about a decade to find my subreddit subscriptions. Things are hard to find, too small or just not there

I like browsing the 'rising' tab, and thus far, I can't seem to be able to find it - if it's there they need to make it easier to see

To give credit where credits due, I like how I can view the subreddit rules while creating my post, this isn't in most of the other Reddit apps.

Warning: Reddit is highly addictive,"This is a PSA to anyone that hasn't started to use Reddit. Reddit is highly addictive and has been known to take hours of your life at a time. Side effects include: loss of productivity, procrastination, loss of job due to less productivity, being late to important events, death due to laughter from memes, increased knowledge about useless facts, new interests in different things from around the world, and increased time in the restroom. 

However, if used properly, you may find that you are more knowledgeable about important subjects such as politics, foreign affairs, and other such subjects that aren't covered by the media. You may also find that you're the first to share the dankest memes on your Facebook, Twitter, and/or Instagram before they become re shared to death by everyone else. 

Please use with caution.",Reddit Official App: Trending News and Hot Topics,US,5,2017-05-27,83,166,>60,4th_quantile
Getting tired of the issues with the iPad version,"If I was writing this from my iPhone I'd be giving the app 5/5 stars, but I'm on my iPad.  The iPad version of this app is pretty pitiful and has been for quite a while.  The UI doesn't properly scale to fill the iPad's larger screen.  The app shouldn't only be using 40% - 50% of the screen real estate directly in the center of the screen with large gaps on both sides.  I shouldn't have to reach into the center of the screen to scroll when using my iPad in landscape.  The app doesn't work properly in split view at all, half of the UI gets cut off which makes the app unusable.  Other than that the App is stable and operates smoothly, I never really have any problems with the app crashing or hanging.  But, until the UI scales to properly fill the entire iPad screen and works properly in split view my review will stay at 3/5 stars.  I've been waiting patiently for quite a while for these problems to be addressed but clearly adding a gradient to the app's icon is more important.  I really love this app (on my iPhone) and know you guys can do better with the iPad version.",Reddit Official App: Trending News and Hot Topics,US,3,2017-05-27,29,116,20-40,3rd_quantile

"(Website, not app review)","I've been on the Reddit app (and Reddit as a whole) for two minutes, and I'm already loving it. This is the app I've been looking for. Not too conservative iFunny, not too liberal Tumblr (even though I'm a proud slightly moderate liberal). I can customize my internet experience the way I want. I'm going to thank my little brother over and over for introducing me to Reddit. I like Instagram, but I'm fed up with it. Facebook ruined the mobile app with trash updates (oh, and also basically stealing snapchat. Bye!) Twitter is too saturated with opinion. Facebook is for my mom who doesn't at all care to see that viral political meme a day later than when it was rising through the ranks on Reddit. (Last night, in fact, I predicted she would see it. It's fine though.) I'm changing my life for the better. This is one step. I am grateful that Reddit is for DISCUSSION.

It's like the developer of this app doesn't browse reddit,"The app serves it's purpose on a platter with holes in it. What's here is nice and works, but it's missing some appetizing features. 
I'll describe what the app needs based on my usage. 
When I open the app, I want to see my favorite subsections. To do that know is not fluid at all. 
I want a tab that will show all of my posts, show date and time, karma, number of replies, route to the post.

Garbage-ish,"Needs Some work. More work! because there is too many rules for everything and I think it's all unfair. The mods say long messages and I don't understand. It's annoying me and making me suffer through annoyingness. I am sorry but it just needs more work. And needs better nicer people because you don't want to get someone annoyed by you and say the f word or yell at you on social media. Its like you can't do anything to help fix the problem. I love reddit but I feel I can't post anything. I have three accounts I think and I'm trying to find out what they are. But I can't. I don't remember. I want to get them deleted for good. So I can only have one account. The mods are nice and some of them are weird. They say too much. I still don't understand the words they mean in their sentences. And all the rules are everywhere and it's hard for me to follow them. I don't know why I can't to reddit in the first place. And I don't know why there are 5828488493948583948578494758948 rules for everything. I mean what the what?! It's annoying, hard, overwhelming, annoying, fun (sometimes), boring, etc... but I still like this app. I just need the rules and everything that annoys people or all that stuff be fixed as well. Plez? I can't stand it *sits on spiny chair* hope you like what your doing! Because your making some people suffer through the rules and trying to follow them and also talking to people for help and then they yell at them. THAT IS NOT NICE. I disagree to treat a person or talk to them that way. TREAT people with RESPECT and all that other stuff people told you about to do! It's easy! Ok I think that's all. :3

And some of the mods are mean or unfair. Just please tone it down with the rules. There are like five thousand eighty nine million rules. Or some how many rules there are. Just tone it down a little please and don't let people use vocabulary words that are super long and hard for me to understand them. And the mods keep telling me ""you can't do this let rule 1"" I mean why can't I do it? I posted other posts like that and you stop me on that one post? And why can't I use text box sometimes? Or something. I don't like being banned or muted. I just god banned and muted twice for 72 hours and the second one.. is permanent. I don't like that idea. I said PLEASE TONE DOWN ON THE RULES. Don't make more rules so we feel like dogs and can't do anything. And people keep saying ""this doesn't belong here you keep just breaking the rules"" and ""you can't do this"" or ""you can't do that"" then why do we HAVE IT THEN?! Huh?! Why? I do hope your doing great Reddit. Your making people suffer of problems because of the mods and some people on there who says things like that and makes people feel bad. It's always me who gets something like""you did this"" ""you can't do that"" ""our just breaking more rules"" STOP WITH THE RULES. TOO MANY. Please it's very annoying to have to read all the rules and forget. Just keep the rules down low. I mean keep only a little bit of rules for all the subs. And hen Reddit will be better.

Oh, yeah and whenever I post something someone says ""you can't do this your just breaking the rules"" THEN WHY CAN OTHER PEOPLE POST IT THEN?????!!!!!! And people keep giving me -1 on my comments on one of my posts! Stop that please! This is a professional app then right? Then why are people posting random stuff? And I post something and it's not aloud and I break the rules????? Idk.. I'm going to destroy this app now. Jk. Maybe. But T.O.N.E it down with the RULES PLEASE!?... and people.

Garbage-ish,"Needs Some work. More work! because there is too many rules for everything and I think it's all unfair. The mods say long messages and I don't understand. It's annoying me and making me suffer through annoyingness. I am sorry but it just needs more work. And needs better nicer people because you don't want to get someone annoyed by you and say the f word or yell at you on social media. Its like you can't do anything to help fix the problem. I love reddit but I feel I can't post anything. I have three accounts I think and I'm trying to find out what they are. But I can't. I don't remember. I want to get them deleted for good. So I can only have one account. The mods are nice and some of them are weird. They say too much. I still don't understand the words they mean in their sentences. And all the rules are everywhere and it's hard for me to follow them. I don't know why I can't to reddit in the first place. And I don't know why there are 5828488493948583948578494758948 rules for everything. I mean what the what?! It's annoying, hard, overwhelming, annoying, fun (sometimes), boring, etc... but I still like this app. I just need the rules and everything that annoys people or all that stuff be fixed as well. Plez? I can't stand it *sits on spiny chair* hope you like what your doing! Because your making some people suffer through the rules and trying to follow them and also talking to people for help and then they yell at them. THAT IS NOT NICE. I disagree to treat a person or talk to them that way. TREAT people with RESPECT and all that other stuff people told you about to do! It's easy! Ok I think that's all. :3

And some of the mods are mean or unfair. Just please tone it down with the rules. There are like five thousand eighty nine million rules. Or some how many rules there are. Just tone it down a little please and don't let people use vocabulary words that are super long and hard for me to understand them. And the mods keep telling me ""you can't do this let rule 1"" I mean why can't I do it? I posted other posts like that and you stop me on that one post? And why can't I use text box sometimes? Or something. I don't like being banned or muted. I just god banned and muted twice for 72 hours and the second one.. is permanent. I don't like that idea. I said PLEASE TONE DOWN ON THE RULES. Don't make more rules so we feel like dogs and can't do anything. And people keep saying ""this doesn't belong here you keep just breaking the rules"" and ""you can't do this"" or ""you can't do that"" then why do we HAVE IT THEN?! Huh?! Why? I do hope your doing great Reddit. Your making people suffer of problems because of the mods and some people on there who says things like that and makes people feel bad. It's always me who gets something like""you did this"" ""you can't do that"" ""our just breaking more rules"" STOP WITH THE RULES. TOO MANY. Please it's very annoying to have to read all the rules and forget. Just keep the rules down low. I mean keep only a little bit of rules for all the subs. And hen Reddit will be better.

Oh, yeah and whenever I post something someone says ""you can't do this your just breaking the rules"" THEN WHY CAN OTHER PEOPLE POST IT THEN?????!!!!!! And people keep giving me -1 on my comments on one of my posts! Stop that please! This is a professional app then right? Then why are people posting random stuff? And I post something and it's not aloud and I break the rules????? Idk.. I'm going to destroy this app now. Jk. Maybe. But T.O.N.E it down with the RULES PLEASE!?... and people.

In new to the network but it's good so far,"Great app in general. I love the concept of Reddit I just dislike the toxic individuals that inhabit Reddit. This is not true for everyone in Reddit, but when you're in Subreddits like /r/LeagueofLegends or /r/GlobalOffensive or any of the other gaming related Subreddits, then you see more of these individuals. The app itself is great, mostly because it's simple. It's not always the easiest to navigate but for the most part it is fairly simple. My only complaint is that I find it hard to locate the Subreddits I am subscribed to without having to search them manually. This is somewhat of a deal breaker for me because I subscribe to a lot of Subreddits and I don't remember the names of all of them. If there's a way to find them without searching for them, I have not yet found it. But yeah, it's a great app.",Reddit Official App: Trending News and Hot Topics,US,4,2017-05-24,12,60,<20,2nd_quantile

A lot of people will say it's for grandmas, but it's not. Reddit's use of communities and subreddits make it easy to find post you would be interested in.

Reddit is a perfect place to go for news, for LOLs, or curiosity. Rather than on Instagram or Twitter, I feel my posts on Reddit have always been appreciated or given constructive criticism by the general public.

Reddit is unique in that it's not about following people and looking at what they're doing, it's about getting in touch with the Reddit communities you love the most.

Have fun going down the rabbit hole,The Reddit app makes it easy to find almost any topic you'd like to connect with. I have spent hours reading through different subjects on Reddit with all the user comments and posts.

Some apps out there similar to Reddit allow you to quickly refresh by pulling down the screen; I'd like to see Reddit do the same.,Reddit Official App: Trending News and Hot Topics,US,4,2017-05-23,34,102,20-40,3rd_quantile
